### Dependencies

* [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)

### Install

* Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/kevinthompson/phaser-template.git`
* Run `npm install`.

### Development

Once you've cloned and installed the template, you can use
[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) to watch and compile files within your development
environment. Start grunt using the `grunt` command, and the development
environment will be setup.

While your development server is running, any coffeescript, stylus, or jade
files created in the `source` folder will be automatically compiled, and your
browser window will automatically refresh.
